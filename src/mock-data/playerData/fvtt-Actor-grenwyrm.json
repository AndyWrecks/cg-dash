On a success, I change the owlbear&rsquo;s attitude toward me from hostile to indifferent or from indifferent to friendly.</p>\n</section>\n<div data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"j5qt\" data-offset-key=\"bsma6-0-0\">\n<div data-offset-key=\"bsma6-0-0\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div data-offset-key=\"bsma6-0-0\">My parents never told me where I was born. From an early age, all I could remember is being in that little home at the edge of town. I lived with all my brothers and sister. Even though I looked like this, the Swiftwhistle family always made me feel welcome. I always knew I was different, that I didn't belong with them. They were halflings and I was, whatever I am. They never showed any disrespect though and I always felt loved.</div>\n</div>\n<div data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"j5qt\" data-offset-key=\"dri0h-0-0\">\n<div data-offset-key=\"dri0h-0-0\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"j5qt\" data-offset-key=\"d0g3n-0-0\">\n<div data-offset-key=\"d0g3n-0-0\">I usually got along well with my siblings, a few of them were different like me as well! My brother Gnarsh and I would go out in the snow, we liked sledding off of the rooftops down to the edge of the lake. My youngest brother, Perrin, would always follow us around. He liked to play with the sticks he could find. He swung them around pretending to be a soldier boy. Callus always thought he knew better, despite his ego he was pretty smart. Anytime there was a problem, I would usually go to him for answers. Our sister Willow was always wandering off to go play in the woods. Gnarsh or Callus would have to go after her.</div>\n</div>\n<div data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"j5qt\" data-offset-key=\"8tu65-0-0\">\n<div data-offset-key=\"8tu65-0-0\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"j5qt\" data-offset-key=\"fjkif-0-0\">\n<div data-offset-key=\"fjkif-0-0\">The summer of my 14th year, I remember well. That's when everything seemed to change for me. It was my turn to go get Willow, she was playing in the nearby forest near our home. She was late to dinner like she always was. It was nothing new for her. I remember walking through the snow with those nifty shoes my father made for us. We could wear them and not sink. Another thing I vividly rememember the auroras, they were usually in the sky this time of year. The shifting curtains of green lights were so beautiful, I never got tired of looking at them. This time they seemed like they were a different color though.</div>\n</div>\n<div data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"j5qt\" data-offset-key=\"976bn-0-0\">\n<div data-offset-key=\"976bn-0-0\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"j5qt\" data-offset-key=\"19esm-0-0\">\n<div data-offset-key=\"19esm-0-0\">As I entered the forest, the sounds of animals were usually plentiful. Sometimes you could even hear her singing. It was silent this time. It was only after I called out to her a few times that I became scared. I didn't like that feeling. When I saw her lying there, my mind froze. Some men had attacked her, some kind of creature. I rushed to her and that's when I felt pain, it was a weird pain in my sides. I looked down and saw an arrow.</div>\n</div>\n<div data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"j5qt\" data-offset-key=\"u1t5-0-0\">\n<div data-offset-key=\"u1t5-0-0\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"j5qt\" data-offset-key=\"m94r-0-0\">\n<div data-offset-key=\"m94r-0-0\"><em>In me?</em></div>\n</div>\n<div data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"j5qt\" data-offset-key=\"8b9tj-0-0\">\n<div data-offset-key=\"8b9tj-0-0\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"j5qt\" data-offset-key=\"6km15-0-0\">\n<div data-offset-key=\"6km15-0-0\"><em>This can't be good...</em></div>\n</div>\n<div data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"j5qt\" data-offset-key=\"92c4m-0-0\">\n<div data-offset-key=\"92c4m-0-0\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"j5qt\" data-offset-key=\"c0168-0-0\">\n<div data-offset-key=\"c0168-0-0\">I looked up and saw the teeth, and then the laugh, it sounded like a hyena. I don't remember much after falling down. I was certain that was my end. You always heard tales of things in the wilds but you never assume they'd come for you. I woke up in a cave somewhere, the first thing my mind noticed was the smell. It was very dark, and damp. I noticed eyes watching me, they weren't eyes like anyone I'd known. When I realized what it was, I felt that cold pang of dread wash over me. It was a hulking form of an owlbear.</div>\n</div>\n<div data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"j5qt\" data-offset-key=\"2epom-0-0\">\n<div data-offset-key=\"2epom-0-0\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"j5qt\" data-offset-key=\"5i8l1-0-0\">\n<div data-offset-key=\"5i8l1-0-0\">The creature didn't attack, it didn't even growl. Maybe it thought I was dead so I didn't move. I remained as still as I could for as long as I could. That's when it reached down and grabbed me by shirt and pulled me up. It was trying to keep me warm. I didn't know if I was alive or dead. Many people are afraid of owlbears, they're well known for their ferocity and strength. I was being nursed back to health by one.</div>\n</div>\n<div data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"j5qt\" data-offset-key=\"eei8p-0-0\">\n<div data-offset-key=\"eei8p-0-0\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"j5qt\" data-offset-key=\"3ure9-0-0\">\n<div data-offset-key=\"3ure9-0-0\">To be continued...</div>\n</div>",

          "value": "<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><p>Golden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she takes to the air.</p><p>Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.</p><p>Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.</p><p>Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can't study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Raw Magic</span></span> <p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.</p><p>The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.</p><p>Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Unexplained Powers</span></span> <p>Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it's unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn't like to stay quiet. A sorcerer's magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn't called on.</p><p>Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Sorcerer</span></span> <p>The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you'll choose an origin that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?</p><p>How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you've been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"4\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions.

On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration.

For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets.
